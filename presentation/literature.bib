abstract="The contact process is often thought of as a model for the spread of infection. The collection of individuals that may be infected at any given time is taken to be the set of vertices of a connected, undirected graph S. For such a graph, the degree of a vertex x is the number of vertices y that are connected to x by an edge. The main examples to be treated below are the d dimensional integer lattice Zd(in which the degree of each vertex is 2d), and the homogeneous tree Tdin which every vertex has degree d +1. In general, we will assume that the degrees of the vertices are uniformly bounded. A path through S is a sequence of consecutive edges in the graph, and its length is the number of edges used. The distance between two vertices x, y âˆˆ S is the minimal length of a path from x to y, and is denoted by |y-x|.",
